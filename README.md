Code for [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) course to build a mini computer from scratch, called the Hack computer.

## Project 1: Elementary Gates

Made elementary gates starting with a given NAND gate, mostly using truth table to convert to boolean function then reducing the expression to available parts.

## Project 2: ALU

Made arithmetic parts then made ALU (which will be part of the CPU), ALU can compute what operation to do e.g. addition and/or negation based on the op-code.

## Project 3: Memory

Made memory parts like registers and RAMs that CPU will use to store and retrieve instructions, using the sequential logic of data flip flops.

## Project 4: Machine Language

Hands-on using Hack computer assembly language to do multiplication and input/output using keyboard and screen.

## Project 5: Computer Architecture

Made memory and CPU and then putting them together to make the underlying computer hardware
